# Dexa — Python Desktop Assistant

Dexa is a Python-based desktop assistant that listens to user commands, analyzes intent, and performs system-level actions using custom tools. It’s designed to automate tasks on your computer using natural language input (voice or text).

- Executes system-level actions via Python tools
- Extensible command & tool integration

Example commands:

## 🚀 How It Works

Dexa uses:
- Python scripts for core logic (`main.py`, `desktop_assistant.py`)
- Tool modules in `tools/` to interact with the OS
- Agent structure in `agents/`
- Utility functions in `utils/`
- Additional scripts `test.py` and `test1.py` for experimentation
